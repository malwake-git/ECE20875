# A client has come to you asking how to perform version control operations with git on their file 'git_commands.py' so that they can work on and submit files to receive credit for a class. To help them, you will fill in variable values so that print statements print out correct output to show them what commands they need to enter. 
#You'll be provided some instructions to accomplish the tasks/questions the client has for you.


#We define a variable called 'cmd' to hold the string 'git'
cmd='git'


# For the rest of the assignment, YOU MUST ASSIGN VALUES TO VARIABLES BY INDEXING THE LIST BELOW. 
# DO NOT JUST TYPE OUT SOMETHING LIKE "' add '" FROM THE LIST.
# Using the commands in the list below, print out the answers to the following questions:
commands=[' (replace this) ', ' pull ',' add --all ',' clone ',' commit -m ', ' add ', ' push ']

#Note that, unlike MATLAB, Python indexing begins at 0 

#Fill in the line below:
cmd1= commands[3]#Replace 0 with the index of the right command from the list 'commands'
